Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has reignited 
interest in the sacred relic by spotlighting 
declassified 1988 CIA documents that allegedly 
used psychic 'remote viewing' to track it. 'The 
CIA allegedly located the Ark of the Covenant,' 
Luna said on the Joe Rogan Experience, calling 
it an 'Indiana Jones moment.' The documents 
detail Remote Viewer No. 032, trained to perceive 
distant objects through psychic means, being given 
coordinates to observe an unidentified target.  
The viewer's notes reportedly described a 'container 
of wood, gold, and silver' adorned with seraphim, 
hidden in a 'dark and wet' underground site in 
a Middle Eastern region with 'mosque domes' and 
Arabic-speaking locals in white robes. 'These 
files were part of the CIA's Project Sun Streak, 
a Cold War-era program exploring psychic phenomena 
for intelligence gathering,' the documents state, 
which were released in 2000. The files resurfaced 
in a March 2025 Daily Mail article. 'We don't know 
how far it went. I definitely have questions, but 
this wouldn't be the first time a government searched 
for something, especially since some theorize that 
the Ark of the Covenant possessed powers akin 
to a superweapon,' Luna said.
